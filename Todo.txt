To do
-----

 - Add all bitmaps for blocks.
 - GridRunner needs to get number of blocks exploded in chains and buffer it
   somewhere.  It might be useful if the grid spat out the number of blocks in
   each chain so that an overall array of chain sets can be created (ie. chain
   set 1 contained 2 chains of 4 blocks each).  This allows us to apply
   multipliers when figuring out how many blocks to dump on the opponent.
 - When grey blocks land on a column that column needs to offset itself by n
   vertical pixels.  Part of the animation process needs to be moving the row
   back to its correct location.  Does the row bounce?
 - Sound effects.
 - Smart AI.
 - Score, level, next block, etc, on bottom screen.
 - Options screen.
 - Title screen.
 - Can the single-player mode be enhanced?  Tetris-style speed increases, levels
   and scores?  Some way to represent the number of blocks exploded/chains as a
   score.  Perhaps:

   - Each block in a chain is a fixed score.
   - Multiply the score by the number of chains to give the score for that
     single group of chains.
   - Multiply the group score by the current group number to give the total
     score for that move.

   So if a player explodes 4 red blocks and 5 green blocks simultaneously, he
   gets block score * (4 + 5) * 2.  Assume block score is 10, giving 180 points.
   The grid drops down and he explodes 4 blue blocks.  The score for that group
   is 40.  However, this is the second group of chains exploded in this move,
   which means we multiply the score by 2.  That gives us a score of 80 for this
   group.  The total score for the move is 180 + 80 = 260 points.
 - Levels advance when n chains have been exploded.  Groups are not relevant.
   In the previous example, the player managed to explode 3 chains in the move
   so his chain count increases by 3.  When he reaches 10 chains (for example),
   the level increases.
 - Mode where everything on the screen must be removed?
 - Additional block colours - orange and green.
 - Block auto drop speed change option.
 - Way to add n grey blocks into random columns in the grid.  Are the columns
   always random?  If we have more blocks to add than there are columns, should
   entire rows be added and any left-overs be added randomly?
