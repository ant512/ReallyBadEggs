To do
-----

 - Add all bitmaps for blocks.
 - Sound effects.
 - Design layout of bottom screen.
 - Options screen:
   - Single player, Tetris A style;
   - Single player, Tetris B style:
     - Grid appears with pre-placed random blocks (determined by height value);
     - Have to earn 25 chains to complete the level.
   - Two player (AI):
     - CPU difficulty option.
   - Initial grid height;
   - Starting level (controls auto drop speed);
   - Enable/disable level increases (enables endless mode as drop speed is
     static);
   - Number of block colours (4-6).
 - High score screen.
 - Title screen.
 - Additional block colours - orange and green.
 - Way to represent grey blocks waiting to fall into grid.
 - Holding down to drop blocks when grid auto drop is faster than manual drop
   slows down the blocks.  Either:
    - Fix this so that if auto drop is faster, manual is ignored;
    - Make manual drop faster by default.
 - Game over condition - cannot place new live blocks.
 - Game over screen.
 - Remove defensive garbage creation (ie. remove incoming before increasing
   outgoing) or make it an option?
