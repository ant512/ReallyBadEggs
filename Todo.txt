To do
-----

 - Add all bitmaps for blocks.
 - GridRunner needs to get number of blocks exploded in chains and buffer it
   somewhere.  It might be useful if the grid spat out the number of blocks in
   each chain so that an overall array of chain sets can be created (ie. chain
   set 1 contained 2 chains of 4 blocks each).  This allows us to apply
   multipliers when figuring out how many blocks to dump on the opponent.
 - When grey blocks land on a column that column needs to offset itself by n
   vertical pixels.  Part of the animation process needs to be moving the row
   back to its correct location.  Does the row bounce?
 - Sound effects.
 - AI, displayed on lower screen.
 - Wifi second player?
 - Options screen.
 - Title screen.
 - If wifi second player does not work, can the single-player mode be enhanced?
   Tetris-style speed increases, levels and scores?
 - Mode where everything on the screen must be removed?
 - Starting grid height optional - greys added to bottom of grid.
 - "Next block" indicator drawn to screen.
 - Additional block colours - orange and green.
 - Block auto drop speed change option.
 - Way to add n grey blocks into random columns in the grid.  Are the columns
   always random?  If we have more blocks to add than there are columns, should
   entire rows be added and any left-overs be added randomly?
