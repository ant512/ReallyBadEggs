To do
-----

Engine

 - Add all bitmaps for blocks.
 - Use bitmaps for incoming garbage display instead of rects and erase old
   display when display is updated.
 - Replace two player background bitmap with components that make up the
   background; this will allow the incoming garbage block display to be removed
   if placed in the top screen borders.  Will also reduce the ROM size
   significantly.
 - Replace winner/loser text with bitmaps.
 - Sound effects.
