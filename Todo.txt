Engine

 - Add all bitmaps for blocks.
 - Represent grey blocks waiting to fall into grid with boulders.  1 block =
   small boulder, 6 blocks = big boulder, 24 blocks = face boulder.
 - Remove defensive garbage creation (ie. remove incoming before increasing
   outgoing) or make it an option?
 - When game is over:
   - Blocks should drop off bottom of dead player's screen?
   - Show winner/loser text.

 - Sound effects.
