To do
-----

 - Title screen on top screen before menu.
 - Title screen also on bottom screen during menu (or variation on title
   screen).

SDL:

 - Add music to title screen.
 - Pan samples left/right depending on player.
 - Set frequency of chain sample depending on score multiplier (doesn't seem to
   be possible in SDL).
