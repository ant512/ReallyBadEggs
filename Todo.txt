To do
-----

Engine

 - Use bitmaps for incoming garbage display instead of rects and erase old
   display when display is updated.
 - Replace "game over" text with bitmap.
 - AI should check that it can rotate/move to the targets, and if not reconsider
   the grid and establish a new target.
 - Perhaps AI should consider the score and the height penalty as separate
   values rather than conflate them into a single variable - will allow more
   informed judgements as to whether a move is worth the height increase.
 - Severe penalty for AI moves that block the top-central 2x2 square of blocks
   in the grid.
