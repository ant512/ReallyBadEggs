To do
-----

 - Add all bitmaps for blocks.
 - GridRunner needs to get number of blocks exploded in chains and buffer it
   somewhere.  It might be useful if the grid spat out the number of blocks in
   each chain so that an overall array of chain sets can be created (ie. chain
   set 1 contained 2 chains of 4 blocks each).  This allows us to apply
   multipliers when figuring out how many blocks to dump on the opponent.
 - When grey blocks land on a column that column needs to offset itself by n
   vertical pixels.  Part of the animation process needs to be moving the row
   back to its correct location.  Does the row bounce?
 - Sound effects.
 - Smart AI.
 - Design layout of bottom screen.
 - Options screen:
   - Single player, Tetris A style;
   - Single player, Tetris B style:
     - Grid appears with pre-placed random blocks (determined by height value);
     - Have to earn 25 of chains to complete the level.
   - Two player (AI):
     - CPU difficulty option.
   - Initial grid height;
   - Starting level (controls auto drop speed);
   - Enable/disable level increases (enables endless mode as drop speed is
     static);
   - Number of block colours (4-6).
 - High score screen.
 - Title screen.
 - Tetris-style level increases should only occur in the single-player game.
   Level indicator should be turned off in the two-player game.
 - Additional block colours - orange and green.
 - Way to add n grey blocks into random columns in the grid.  Are the columns
   always random?  If we have more blocks to add than there are columns, should
   entire rows be added and any left-overs be added randomly?  How many greys
   should be added?
