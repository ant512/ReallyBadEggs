To do
-----

Engine

 - Additional block colours - orange and green.
 - Add all bitmaps for blocks.
 - Represent grey blocks waiting to fall into grid with boulders.  1 block =
   small boulder, 6 blocks = big boulder, 24 blocks = face boulder.
 - Game over condition - cannot place new live blocks.
 - Holding down to drop blocks when grid auto drop is faster than manual drop
   slows down the blocks.  Either:
    - Fix this so that if auto drop is faster, manual is ignored;
    - Make manual drop faster by default.
 - Remove defensive garbage creation (ie. remove incoming before increasing
   outgoing) or make it an option?

 - Sound effects.
