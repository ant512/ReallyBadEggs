Scoring
-------

The formula for each chain is:

  10 * blocks * (blocks - 3) * sequence

Where:

 - blocks is the number of blocks in the chain;
 - (blocks - 3) is the number of extra blocks in the chain above the 4 minimum;
 - sequence is the number of times the grid has chained and dropped in sequence.

If a player explodes a chain of 4 red blocks and a chain of 5 green blocks
simultaneously, he gets the following scores:

  10 * 4 * (4 - 3) * 1 = 40
  10 * 5 * (5 - 3) * 1 = 100

He gets a total of 140 points for the two chains.

The grid drops down to fill in any gaps, and in doing so creates another chain
of 4 blue blocks.  These explode giving the following score:

  10 * 4 * (4 - 3) * 2 = 80

He gets 10 points for each block (10 * 4 = 40).  The chain includes only the
minimum number of blocks (4 - 3) so he gets no bonus there.  However, this is
the second set of chains exploded, so the final score is doubled (40 * 2 = 80).
The running total so far is 120.

The grid drops to fill in any gaps again, and two more chains are created: 6
yellow blocks and 5 orange blocks.  The scores this time are:

  10 * 6 * (6 - 3) * 3 = 540
  10 * 5 * (5 - 3) * 3 = 300

The total for these two chains is 840, giving an overall score of 960.

Play then resumes, and the sequence multiplier resets to 1.


Garbage
-------

The amount of garbage generated by chains is calculated using the following
formula:

  score / 40

40 is the score given for exploding a single chain of 4 blocks.  So, if a player
explodes 4 blocks in one chain, one garbage block will be generated.  If a
player then explodes 6 blocks in one chain immediately afterwards due to blocks
falling to fill in the gaps in the grid, another 9 blocks are generated.  The
score is:

  10 * 6 * (6 - 3) * 2 = 360

The number of blocks is therefore:

  360 / 40 = 9

If the player has any incoming garbage blocks, their numbers are reduced before
the outgoing count is increased.  For example, if the player has 6 incoming
garbage blocks, the number of outgoing blocks will be:

  9 - 6 = 3

The number of incoming blocks will be 0.  However, if the player has 11 incoming
garbage blocks, the number of outgoing blocks would be 0, whilst the incoming
blocks would be:

  11 - 9 = 2

Levels
------

Play advances through one level every time 10 chains are created.  The current
level can therefore be said to be equal to the integer result of
(total chains / 10).  Each increase in level increases the speed at which blocks
automatically drop down the screen.
